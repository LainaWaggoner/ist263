 <h1> Laina Waggoners Biography </h1>
<p> Hello! My name is <strong>Laina Waggoner</strong> and I’m a junior majoring in IMT with a concentration in Project Management. I have skills in coding including Python, Java, C++ and other soft skills including team building, communication, and public speaking skills. I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts and during the summer I work in Ocean City Maryland as a server. I don’t love television, but my favorite movie is Fantastic Mr. Fox and I’m currently watching the Sopranos.I've played multiple sports including Lacrosse and Soccer and have 3 siblings total. </p>
<p> I'm looking forward to studying abroad in Sydney AUS in the Spring of this year and so far the transition coming back to Syracuse has been lots of fun. Many of my friends share the same major as I do and we are all currently looking into living in a house together on Comstock for the following school year. </p>
<p> Both of my parents are U.S History Teachers and I spent many vacations growing up going to battlegrounds and other historical relevant places. I hope to spend this next year making new frends and spending less money on clothes and items I don't need. </p>
