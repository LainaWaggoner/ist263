Hello! My name is Laina Waggoner and I’m a junior majoring in IMT with a concentration in Project Management. I have skills in coding including Python, Java, C++ and other soft skills including team building, communication, and public speaking skills. I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts and during the summer I work in Ocean City Maryland as a server. I don’t love television, but my favorite movie is Fantastic Mr. Fox and I’m currently watching the Sopranos.
