            <h2>Welcome to My Fashion Blog</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Laina Waggoner, and I’m currently a student at Syracuse University, majoring in Information Management and Technology. My interests span across fashion trends, trend forecasting based on data analytics, and AI technology which is reflected in my personal projects and academic journey. I’m from Salisbury Maryland and going to school in New York has exposed me to a vibrant, eclectic mix of styles. The contrast between the laid-back, coastal vibe of Maryland and the fashion-forward, bold choices of Syracuse University students is fascinating.</p>
            <p>I’ve also enjoyed seeing how Syracuse Greek life has influenced fashion on campus, with each house representing its own distinct style. From preppy, polished looks to bold, statement pieces, Greek life adds another layer to the diverse fashion culture here. My goal is to highlight trends I find particularly intriguing, whether they're emerging globally or right here on campus.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I plan to include photos of Syracuse University students showcasing their personal style around campus. By capturing a variety of looks from students on their way to class to more polished event outfits, I hope to capture the unique spirit of campus fashion and the ways individuals express themselves.</p>

            <h2>Featured Trend of the Week</h2>
            <p>The trend for this week is chunky loafers. You heard me right, style icons like Taylor Swift and Dakota Johnson are showing off their love for these versatile shoes, proving them to be the go-to fall staple. Besides celebrities, students on campus have been spotted wearing these shoes with flowy midi skirts or dresses to balance the feminine softness with the shoe's bold structure. Others are wearing them with a classic black tee and laid-back blue jeans for a more relaxed vibe.</p>
            <p>So how long will these shoes be in for? I’d argue this shoe will likely remain popular for at least a couple of seasons. They can be dressed up or down, making them suitable for various occasions. They are comfortable, and the classic design can be evolved with new materials, colors, and textures to keep them relevant.</p>
