            <h2>Past & Future â€“ How Accurate is Trend Forecasting?</h2>
            <p>To understand and forecast trends we must understand the trend cycle. Fashion trends typically follow a cycle of about 20-30 years before they resurface in popular culture. Social media has also changed the trend cycle in many ways, allowing trends to emerge and spread more rapidly, often within days or weeks.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional fashion cycles that could take months to develop, trends can go viral overnight through platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter. AI has also changed the trend cycle by helping brands quickly spot and respond to what consumers want.</p>
            <p>Predicting consumer behavior is difficult for anyone, but particularly for college students, who are often at the forefront of trendsetting. Their styles can change quickly, and their limited budgets affect their purchasing decisions.</p>
            <p>Trend accuracy has varied over the years but trends like athleisure have been accurately predicted, showcasing how lifestyle changes can create demand for new types of clothing.</p>
