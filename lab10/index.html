        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Laina Waggoner</strong>, and I’m a junior majoring in IMT with a concentration in Project Management. I have skills in coding, including Python, Java, and C++, and soft skills in team building, communication, and public speaking. I enjoy reading and listening to podcasts. During the summer, I work in Ocean City, Maryland, as a server. I don’t love television, but my favorite movie is <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em>, and I’m currently watching <em>The Sopranos</em>. I've played multiple sports, including lacrosse and soccer, and I have three siblings.</p>

        <p>I'm looking forward to studying abroad in Sydney, Australia, in the spring of this year. So far, the transition back to Syracuse has been fun. Many of my friends share the same major, and we are all looking into living in a house together on Comstock next school year.</p>

        <p>Both of my parents are U.S. history teachers, and I spent many vacations visiting battlegrounds and other historically relevant places. I hope to spend this year making new friends and spending less money on clothes and things I don’t need.</p>
